## Summary-
   The analysis of this election show that:
        It is easy to audit for votes for any County. It would require very minimum modifications as we would require the csv file containing the correct information.
        After that it would be easy just to pull the data.
        One example from the code regarding modification can be the source of file and the other could be the data used for analysis. If the data is not in order 
        as was used for this code then it would give errors. 
        Again in the beginning of code one has to be careful of the columns.
